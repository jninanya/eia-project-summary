# eia-project-summary

This bookdown aims to summarize and document the analysis performed and findings obtained as part of the [**Excellence in Agronomy (EiA) Initiative**](https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/11-excellence-in-agronomy-eia-solutions-for-agricultural-transformation/) in **Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)** region, specifically **Peru**. EiA is one of a series of [**CGIAR Initiatives**](https://www.cgiar.org/research/cgiar-portfolio/) that belongs to the **Environmental health & biodiversity** impact area and whose aim is *"to achieve sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems, benefiting the agricultural resource base and its native organisms"*. Regarding the EiA LAC-Peru Use Case, the study area is located in the Chugay District, Sanchez Carrión Province, La Libertad region. This project is led by [**David A. Ramírez**](http://www.davidramirezc.com/) from [**CIP**](https://cipotato.org/) working hand in hand with local partners led by **Ronal Otiniano** from NGO [**Asociación Pataz**](https://www.asociacionpataz.org.pe/).

The main activities planned for the LAC-Peru Use Case were/are:

1. Agronomic data digitization using the e-Agrology platform(*in progress*). 
2. Long-term demonstration trials of agronomic practices with potential for Climate Change mitigation (*in progress*).
3. Remote sensing techniques applied to the LAC-Peru Use Case (*in progress*). 
4. Yield gap decomposition analysis (*in progress*).

For any request about the dataset or output/product generated and any comment about this bookdown, please contact David A. Ramírez (**d.ramirez@cgiar.org**).
